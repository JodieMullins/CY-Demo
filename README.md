# CY-Demo

Three separate data files are fed into the Jupyter Notebook to create a data analysis project complete with graphs. 

A folder and csv file are generated containing profit details for the business. 

A sqlite3 database is also created within this Jupyter Notebook, and before closing, will populate a specifically queried email list. 

The end of the notebook contains a link to my Tableau Public workbook utilizing the data from this repository to further answer any questions regarding profits or placement of a storefront.
