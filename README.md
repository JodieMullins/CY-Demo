# CY-Demo

Three separate data files are fed into the Jupyter Notebook to create a data analysis project complete with graphs. 

A folder and csv file are generated containing profit details for the business. 

A sqlite3 database is also created within this Jupyter Notebook, and before closing, will populate a specifically queried email list.
