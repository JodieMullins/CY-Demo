# CY-Demo

Three separate data files are fed into the Jupyter Notebook 'Demo' to create a data analysis project complete with graphs. 

A csv is created and held in one folder, while a series of graphs and charts are generated and stored within another folder.

A sqlite3 database is also created within this Jupyter Notebook, and before closing, will populate a specifically queried email list. 

The end of the notebook contains a link to my Tableau Public workbook utilizing the data from this repository to further answer any questions regarding profits or placement of a storefront.

To clarify:

Capstone_Preview is a standalone document for an idea of the final resulting project to come; it is for display only and cannot be ran.

Demo is the Notebook to feed the files of this repository into; it is the working document of this repository intended for general demonstration of project output.

You may choose to simply look at the Preview, or you may otherwise choose to operate your own version of the prelimary project established October 2023 using 'Demo' and accompanying csv / json files.
